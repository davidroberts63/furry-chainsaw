Static offline capable QR code generator for conference attendees

Get a QR code reader, read your current conference badge. Enter the data and the modify what you need (email address) and let the vendors scan that. Please, be responsible and courteous to the vendors by keeping the data real. They do a lot for conferences.

I'm **attempting** to create a QR code for use with vendors that will have custom email addresses for each one. I have my own domain with email and I have custom addresses for each company. At the conferences the vendors scan your badge (typically with a QR code) in which the email address is located.
